# BASICS OF WEB

 Response Status Codes are a way of communicating to the servers if something went wrong or not. Like 404 is page not found. 
 
If your computer is a house, think of ports as doors (ways to enter and exit the house). You can have multiple ports opened that allow the processes to go in and out of the system. 

Ports 0 to 1023 are privileged ports meaning they need admin rights to be "opened". Some ports are reserved : 

```
80 & 8080 = HTTP
443 & 8443 = HTTPS
22 = SSH
```

Port ranges from 0 to 65535. This means you cannot start a process on 70000.

***GET** - You don't send any custom data to the web. Not logging in, just browsing. This is the defalt method.*

***POST** - You want to interact (send some data) to the server. Passowrds and logging in.* 

HTTP is built on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Even when HTTP connection is over, TCP should be kept alive for lower level transmissions.
